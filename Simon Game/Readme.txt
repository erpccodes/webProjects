# Simon Game


## Description

Simon is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors generated by the computer. The game starts with a single color, and as the player successfully reproduces the sequence, it increases in length, challenging the player's memory.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Press any key to start the game.
4. Watch the computer's color sequence and listen to the corresponding sounds.
5. Click on the buttons in the same order as the computer's sequence.
6. If you match the entire sequence, the game will advance to the next level, adding one more color to the sequence.
7. If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can restart by pressing any key again.
